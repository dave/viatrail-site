        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: 2 February 2025</p>

        <h2>Acceptance of terms</h2>
        <p>By using Via Trail ("the app"), you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, do not use the app.</p>

        <h2>Description of service</h2>
        <p>Via Trail is an offline hiking map application that provides map display, route creation, trip planning, track recording, and optional cloud backup. The app is provided as-is for personal, non-commercial use.</p>

        <h2>User accounts</h2>
        <p>Some features (backup, restore) require an account. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials. You may delete your account at any time from the app's settings.</p>

        <h2>Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use the app for any unlawful purpose</li>
            <li>Attempt to access other users' data</li>
            <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the app beyond what is permitted by law</li>
            <li>Use the app to store or transmit malicious content</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Safety disclaimer</h2>
        <p><strong>Via Trail is a planning and navigation aid, not a substitute for proper preparation, equipment, and judgment when hiking or travelling in the outdoors.</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do not rely solely on this app for navigation. Always carry a physical map and compass</li>
            <li>GPS signals can be inaccurate, especially in canyons, dense forest, or bad weather</li>
            <li>Routes calculated by the app may not reflect actual trail conditions, closures, or hazards</li>
            <li>Offline maps may be outdated. Trail conditions change</li>
            <li>Battery life is limited. Plan accordingly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We are not liable for any injury, loss, or damage resulting from the use of this app in outdoor activities.</p>

        <h2>Map data and attribution</h2>
        <p>Map data is provided by OpenStreetMap contributors and other sources. Map data accuracy is not guaranteed. See individual data source licenses for details.</p>

        <h2>Subscriptions and payments</h2>
        <p>Some features may require a paid subscription. Subscriptions are managed through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store and are subject to their respective terms. You can cancel a subscription at any time through your device's store settings.</p>

        <h2>Limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Via Trail and its developer shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages resulting from your use of the app.</p>

        <h2>Changes to these terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.</p>
