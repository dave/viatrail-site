        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Viatrail ("the app") is an offline-first hiking map application. Your data stays on your device by default. We only collect data when you explicitly choose to use features that require it.</p>

        <h2>Data stored on your device</h2>
        <p>The following data is stored locally on your device and is never sent to our servers unless you enable backup:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Imported routes, tracks, and waypoints</li>
            <li>Routes you create and tracks you record</li>
            <li>Trip plans and display rule sets</li>
            <li>Downloaded map tiles</li>
            <li>App preferences and settings</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data we collect when you create an account</h2>
        <p>If you choose to create an account (required for backup), we collect:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email address</strong> — for account identification and communication</li>
            <li><strong>Authentication tokens</strong> — from Apple Sign-In, Google Sign-In, or email/password login</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data we collect when you enable backup</h2>
        <p>If you enable the optional backup feature, we store:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your library data (routes, tracks, waypoints, plans, display rules, folder structure)</li>
            <li>Your app preferences</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Backup data is stored in encrypted S3-compatible storage and is associated with your account. Backup is one-way (device to server) and is used solely for restoring your data to a new device.</p>

        <h2>Location data</h2>
        <p>The app uses your device's GPS for map display, navigation, and track recording. Location data is processed entirely on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store your location on our servers.</p>
        <p>When you record a track, the GPS data is stored locally on your device as part of your library. It is only sent to our servers if you have backup enabled.</p>

        <h2>Search</h2>
        <p>When you search for places while online, your search query and approximate map location are sent to our server to return relevant results. We do not log or store search queries.</p>

        <h2>Third-party services</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>MapTiler / OpenMapTiles</strong> — provides map tiles. Subject to their <a href="https://www.maptiler.com/privacy-policy/">privacy policy</a></li>
            <li><strong>Apple Sign-In / Google Sign-In</strong> — if you choose these sign-in methods, subject to their respective privacy policies</li>
            <li><strong>Sentry</strong> — crash reporting. Collects anonymous crash data (no personal information). Subject to their <a href="https://sentry.io/privacy/">privacy policy</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data retention and deletion</h2>
        <p>You can delete your account at any time from the app's settings. This permanently deletes all server-side data (account information, backup data, preferences) within 30 days.</p>
        <p>Local data on your device is not affected by account deletion and remains under your control.</p>

        <h2>Children's privacy</h2>
        <p>The app is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13.</p>

        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.</p>
